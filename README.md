# SousVide-Interface
Main files

This is a personal project that is currently a work in progress.

In essense it is the code for a custom-built sous vide machine (water cooker) that uses the arduino to interface
between a temperature sensor, heater (using a relay), and LCD screen to cook a given food at C temperature for
T ammount of time.

Works at a basic level but will be improved upon later for conistent and repeated use over time.
